* Homebase

Homebase serves as a central hub for accessing a variety of content, including live streams from YouTube and Twitch, videos on demand (VODs), and RSS feeds.
It has a client-server design, where the server performs the task of obtaining the content and the client offers a user interface for viewing the content.

Three different user interfaces are available: a web-based interface, an android mobile app and a terminal-based interface.
Whether you prefer using a web browser, mobile app or the terminal, Homebase has you covered.

/Only the terminal interface is available right now/
