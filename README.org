* Homebase
Homebase is a hub for consuming different types of content, including YouTube and Twitch livestreams, VODs, and RSS feeds.
The project is built using a server-client architecture, where the server handles the work of getting the content and the client provides a frontend for viewing the content.
There are two different frontends available: a web-based one and a terminal-based one.
